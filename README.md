# 🏦 Bank Transaction Analysis

This project performs **data analysis and clustering** on bank transaction data using machine learning techniques in Python. It helps in understanding customer behavior, transaction patterns, and spending categories based on transaction records.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `bank_transaction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code pipeline — from data import and preprocessing to clustering and visualization.
- `.gitignore`: To avoid tracking unnecessary files like `.zip` archives or temporary data files.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning of bank transaction data  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✅ Dimensionality reduction for visualization  
- ✅ Clustering using unsupervised learning techniques  
- ✅ Visualization of customer segments and insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Plotly** *(optional)*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bank_transaction.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Results & Visuals

You’ll find multiple clustering results and interactive visualizations within the notebook, including 2D cluster plots and confusion matrices.

## 📌 To Do

- [ ] Integrate with real-time transaction feed (API)
- [ ] Add transaction categorization using NLP
- [ ] Build a dashboard for end users
